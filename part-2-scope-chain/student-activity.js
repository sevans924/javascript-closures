//A closure called innerFunc has been defined for you below, but it is missing it's parents. 
//1. Wrap innerFunction in at least 2 more parent functions so that it is a true closure.
//2. Define variables a - g at different levels of the scope chain, from local to global.
//3. Assign values to the variables so that when you finally invoke your closure, the result is exactly 100.
