///////////Lexical Environment

//1. Build out the empty counter function below to create a counter and a closure that can operate on the counter(increment, decrement, add 5, etc.).
//2. Define 2 variables and assign them the value of your counter function so that each variable has a different value when invoked(just like the example that you completed with your instructor).
//3. Extension: Experiment with returning an object
