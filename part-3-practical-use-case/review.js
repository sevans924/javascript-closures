//1. Build out the empty counter function below to create a counter and a closure that can operate on the counter(increment, decrement, add 5, etc.).
//2. Define 2 variables and assign them the value of your counter function so that each variable has a different value when invoked(just like the example that you completed with your instructor).
//3. Optional Extension: Experiment with returning an object whose keys values allow you to operate on your counter or return data using anonymous functions. This is a preview of Object-Oriented Programming.



function counter(){

}

////////////////////Protecting Data
//1. Remember this from the introduction? Use what you know about closures to check to see if userInput matches the password stored within the function. You may use a conditional statement or blaze a new trail!
