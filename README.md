# javascript-closures
Skills Assessment for 2U: Included in this repository is a lesson plan and activities on the topic of 'Closures in Javascript'.

### Defining Terms and Assumptions

__Stoking Curiosity:__
* ‘The Hook’
 * a tool used to engage students in a concept 
* Encourage students to draw connections between the concept and their own experience, other coding concepts, or the world

__Real World Problem:__
* Applying skills to a scenario that a student might find while working as a developer or a scenario in which the concept may be applied to the student’s own personal projects

__Prior knowledge of students:__
* Online learning
* Access to other students via slack, etc.
* Asynchronous learning - concepts are introduced in recorded lectures that students can either attend, or watch later, activities are done at student’s pace
* Students have covered basic data types and know how to declare a function
* Students have encountered vocbulary associated with functions and different types of functions (function expression, anonymous function, arrow function, IIFE, etc.) but may not have yet mastered them
* Students are familiar with basic scope and hoisting


## Overview


## Objectives

### Students will be able to...
* define 'closure' in JavaScript in their own words
* define scope chain in their own words
* describe practical use cases for closures

## Introduction

## Instructor Demo 1: Closures
### Key terms and points
* Define the term 'closure'
* Demonstrate how to invoke a closure
* 'Function-level scope'
* Closures have access to variables and parameters that belong to all parent functions.

### Notes
* The instructor-demo file contains a function called, 'onion'. Ask students to predict what will happen when you console.log(onion()). Discuss predictions, invoke the function, discuss the outcome ([Function: insideOnion]).
* Tell students that insideOnion() is a closure, and that they will be able to define this term in their own words by the end of the lesson.
* Ask students how they can access the function insideOnion(). If students aren't sure, guide them towards onion()().  _(extension: Demonstrate other ways to invoke a closure.)_
* Once the closure has been invoked, ask them to notice what was logged. What does this tell them about closures and scope? What do they have access to? _Closures have access to variables and parameters that belong to all parent functions._
* Ask students to summarize what they know about closures so far.
+ a closure is a function inside of a parent function
+ several ways to invoke a closure
+ closures have access to variables and parameters that belong to all parent functions.

## Instructor Demo 2: Scope Chain

### Key terms and points
* Define 'scope chain'
* Closures inherit variable and parameter from their parents
