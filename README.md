Skills Assessment for 2U: Included in this repository is a lesson plan and activities on the topic of 'Closures in Javascript'.

### Defining Terms and Assumptions

__Stoking Curiosity:__
* ‘The Hook’
 * a tool used to engage students in a concept 
* Encourage students to draw connections between the concept and their own experience, other coding concepts, or the world

__Real World Problem:__
* Applying skills to a scenario that a student might find while working as a developer or a scenario in which the concept may be applied to the student’s own personal projects

__Prior knowledge of students:__
* Online learning
* Access to other students via slack, etc.
* Asynchronous learning - concepts are introduced in recorded lectures that students can either attend, or watch later, activities are done at student’s pace
* Students have covered basic data types and know how to declare a function
* Students have encountered vocbulary associated with functions and different types of functions (function expression, anonymous function, arrow function, IIFE, etc.) but may not have yet mastered them
* Students are familiar with basic scope and hoisting
